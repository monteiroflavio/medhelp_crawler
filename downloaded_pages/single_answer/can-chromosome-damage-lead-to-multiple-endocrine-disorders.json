    "question": "I am wondering if I\u00a0\u00a0could have had nesidioblastosis from a gene that was damaged in mybody when I was born. I have multiple endocrine diseases, neurological as well associated as complications from my endocrine problems.Seizures from epilepsy, having had to have 2 partial pancreatectomies from producing 10 times too much insulin, diabetes in both sides of my family, asthma in my mother's side, A1AD in my father's side, thyroid problems in both sides of the family. I inherited all of these problems and it becomes confusing sometimes when trying to find answers to why my body has developed the disorders and diseases it has.Can exposure to radiation be the reason why I have so many things wrong? My mother had her teeth x-rayed before she realized she was pregnant with me. Could this be the cause of the nesidioblastosis? I know that my diabetes and other health problems were from genetic inheritance from my parents genes, but I didn't develop diabetes until I was ten and suffered from a flu that destroyed most of the beta cells in my pancreas. I also have a carrier form of A1AD that complicates my breathing along with asthma...can you explain some of the genetic problems that occured to me as a fetus?Your time and input into this matter is always appreciated.Meg",
